    <p>My name is Alexandra Denisova.</p>

    <p>For two years, I worked as a backend developer at Yandex, writing services related to application stability audit, payment administration, and transaction feed reflection. Even after entering commercial development, I never stopped dreaming of a scientific career and doing work in the laboratory.</p>

    <p>I mostly worked on scientific projects on weekends and evenings. In the end, I decided that I wanted to devote myself entirely to science and quit my job, thus beginning my slow journey back to academia.</p>

    <p>My interests mainly lie in the field of the evolution of cognitive abilities of birds, in particular the convergence between birds and humans. At the moment, I am working on two related projects: comparing innovation in different bird species and solving problems in <i>Zonotrichia atricapilla</i>.</p>

    <p>As a full-time employee, I now work as an assistant director of science at Genotek, a company specializing in genetic testing. As part of my work, I conduct several research projects, including on oral microbiology and cardiogenetics. A project on voice genetics is also planned.</p>

    <p>I strive to live in a world where the pursuit of science is a natural extension of human aspirations. At the same time, doing science is inseparable for me and is an art.</p>

    <p>Here I plan to share my notes, projects, and poetry, as freely as I can.</p>

        <div class="poem-excerpt">
            Вода бежала. Я смотрела в воду, свой облик отдавая ей одной. Вода бежала. Проходила бродом. Переберя прибрежных ив покой. 
            Вода бежала. Я в неё глядела. За километры ив оставив плеть. Вода бежала. Было бы ей дело как изнутри себя в меня глядеть.
